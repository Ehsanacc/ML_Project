This method computes the average output probabilities from multiple models to make a final prediction. Here’s why this method might have been chosen over the other options:\n\n1. **Average Aggregation (Adaptive Aggregation)**:\n   - **Reason for Choosing**: This method is straightforward and often effective in ensemble learning because it reduces variance and improves generalization. By averaging the predictions of multiple models, it can smooth out individual model biases and errors.\n   - **Applicability**: It works well when models are diverse enough in their predictions and errors are not correlated strongly across models.\n\n2. **Majority Voting**:\n   - **Description**: In majority voting, each model gives a categorical prediction (e.g., class labels), and the final prediction is the mode (most frequent prediction) among all models.\n   - **Reason for Not Choosing**: Majority voting is more suitable when dealing with discrete predictions. Since my models output probabilities, averaging is a more natural choice.\n\n3. **Hierarchical Aggregation**:\n   - **Description**: This method involves aggregating predictions in a structured hierarchy, often used in contexts where decisions need to be made at multiple levels.\n   - **Reason for Not Choosing**: It’s typically used in complex decision-making frameworks where decisions at different levels of abstraction or granularity are required. For my classification task, averaging suffices without the added complexity.\n\nIn summary, **Average Aggregation** (or Adaptive Aggregation) was likely chosen in my code because it balances simplicity with effectiveness in aggregating probabilistic outputs from multiple models, aligning well with the task of averaging softmax probabilities for classification.\n\n\nP.S. According to the Head TA, implementing only one of the aggregation methods is neccessary.\nP.S. Results for all wanted parts of Question 1 and 2 is shown at the end of this file.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.optim as optim\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader, Subset\nfrom torchvision import datasets, transforms, models\nfrom torch.cuda.amp import GradScaler, autocast  #

Too many slices might fragment the data excessively, diminishing returns.\n\n### Conclusions:\n\n- **Optimal Configuration:**\n  - For the given simulation, the configuration \\( S = 5 \\) and \\( R = 10 \\) achieves the best overall performance across metrics.\n  - This suggests a moderate number of shards with a balanced number of slices yields the best results.\n\n- **Effects of Increasing S and R:**\n  - Increasing \\( S \\) too much can negatively impact performance due to overly segmented training data.\n  - Increasing \\( R \\) helps up to a point, but excessive slicing can lead to diminished returns.\n\nThis analysis can guide future implementations of the SISA algorithm by emphasizing the importance of finding a balanced configuration for \\( S \\) and \\( R \\).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pickle\n\n\n# Save to file\nwith open('/kaggle/working/results.pkl', 'wb') as f:\n    pickle.dump(results, f)\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-07-03T03:39:14.983875Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-07-03T03:39:14.984660Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-07-03T03:39:19.019744Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-07-03T03:39:14.984623Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-07-03T03:39:19.018950Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import random\n# Parameters for training\nS_values = [5, 10]  #

This is expected as the removal of data and subsequent retraining lead to some loss in the model's capacity to generalize.\n- **Relative Rankings:** The relative performance ranking of configurations remains consistent. For instance, \\( S = 5, R = 20 \\) and \\( S = 10, R = 20 \\) remain the top performers even in the unlearning phase, indicating that a higher number of slices provides robustness to the model.\n\n### Conclusions:\n\n- **Optimal Configuration for Unlearning:**\n  - Similar to the learning phase, the configuration \\( S = 5 \\) and \\( R = 20 \\) shows strong performance during the unlearning phase.\n  - Increasing \\( R \\) generally aids in better performance during unlearning, while higher \\( S \\) (shards) can still degrade the performance due to excessive data segmentation.\n\n- **Effects of Unlearning:**\n  - The SISA algorithm effectively supports selective data removal while managing computational costs.\n  - Maintaining a moderate number of shards with a higher number of slices seems to strike a good balance between the granularity of control and the overall model performance.\n\nBy understanding these trends, the SISA algorithm can be effectively tuned to handle scenarios where data needs to be forgotten while maintaining as much model performance as possible.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Save to file\nwith open('/kaggle/working/unlearning_results.pkl', 'wb') as f:\n    pickle.dump(unlearning_results, f)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-07-03T03:57:26.395716Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-07-03T03:57:26.395990Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-07-03T03:57:31.858409Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-07-03T03:57:26.395965Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-07-03T03:57:31.857406Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":6,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader, Subset\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegressionCV\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\nimport random\n\n# Compute losses for a given model and dataset\ndef compute_losses(model, data_loader):\n    model.eval()\n    criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss(reduction='none')\n    losses = []\n    \n    with torch.no_grad():\n        for inputs, labels in data_loader:\n            inputs, labels = inputs.to(device), labels.to(device)\n            outputs = model(inputs)\n            loss = criterion(outputs, labels)\n            losses.extend(loss.cpu().numpy())\n    \n    return losses\n\n# Membership Inference Attack using Logistic Regression\ndef membership_inference_attack(forget_losses, test_losses):\n    X = np.concatenate([forget_losses, test_losses]).reshape(-1, 1)\n    y = np.concatenate([np.ones(len(forget_losses)), np.zeros(len(test_losses))])\n    \n    model = LogisticRegressionCV(cv=5).fit(X, y)\n    scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5)\n    \n    return np.mean(scores)\n\n# Evaluate membership inference attack for trained and unlearned models\ndef evaluate_membership_inference(trained_models, unlearned_models, forget_indices, test_loader):\n    results = {}\n    \n    #

Typically, a model trained on a dataset will have lower losses or higher confidence on that data compared to unseen data, due to overfitting. By analyzing these differences, an attacker can infer whether a data point was part of the training set, which can lead to privacy concerns.\n\n#### MIA Simulation Results:\n\nThe results show the MIA scores for both trained and unlearned models across different configurations of \\( S \\) (shards) and \\( R \\) (slices).\n\n### Results Summary:\n\n1. **S = 5, R = 5:**\n   - **Trained Model:** 0.5044\n   - **Unlearned Model:** 0.5104\n\n2. **S = 5, R = 10:**\n   - **Trained Model:** 0.5064\n   - **Unlearned Model:** 0.5134\n\n3. **S = 5, R = 20:**\n   - **Trained Model:** 0.5066\n   - **Unlearned Model:** 0.4942\n\n4. **S = 10, R = 5:**\n   - **Trained Model:** 0.5034\n   - **Unlearned Model:** 0.4903\n\n5. **S = 10, R = 10:**\n   - **Trained Model:** 0.5075\n   - **Unlearned Model:** 0.4950\n\n6. **S = 10, R = 20:**\n   - **Trained Model:** 0.5027\n   - **Unlearned Model:** 0.4962\n\n### Analysis of MIA Scores:\n\n1. **Expected Outcome for a Perfectly Unlearned Model:**\n   - For a perfectly unlearned model, the MIA score should be close to 0.5. This indicates that the model is equally likely to classify a data point as part of the training set or not, meaning it does not have distinguishable behavior for data it was trained on versus unseen data. Essentially, it suggests the model has successfully \"forgotten\" the data and behaves as if it was never trained on that data.\n\n2. **Performance of SISA Algorithm:**\n   - **General Trend:** \n     - For most configurations, the MIA scores for the unlearned models are close to or slightly above 0.5, suggesting a slight decrease in distinguishability between training and non-training data after unlearning.\n     - The slight increase or decrease in scores close to 0.5 implies that the SISA algorithm effectively mitigates the differences in how the model treats the forgotten data versus new data.\n  \n   - **Best Performers:**\n     - For \\( S = 10 \\), \\( R = 5 \\) and \\( S = 10 \\), \\( R = 10 \\), the MIA scores for the unlearned models are slightly below 0.5 (0.4903 and 0.4950 respectively), indicating that the model is less capable of distinguishing the forgotten data from new data, which aligns with the goal of unlearning.\n     - \\( S = 5 \\), \\( R = 20 \\) also shows a significant drop in the MIA score for the unlearned model (0.4942), suggesting effective unlearning.\n\n   - **Less Effective Configurations:**\n     - For \\( S = 5 \\), \\( R = 5 \\) and \\( S = 5 \\), \\( R = 10 \\), the MIA scores for the unlearned models are slightly above 0.5 (0.5104 and 0.5134 respectively), indicating these configurations were less effective at unlearning compared to others.\n\n### Conclusions:\n\n1. **Effectiveness of SISA in Unlearning:**\n   - The SISA algorithm generally performs well in making the model \"forget\" specific data, as indicated by the MIA scores hovering around 0.5 after unlearning.\n   - Configurations with higher \\( R \\) (number of slices) tend to show better unlearning performance. This aligns with the previous observation that more slices allow for finer control and adjustments during the unlearning phase.\n\n2. **Optimal Configuration:**\n   - Among the tested configurations, \\( S = 5 \\), \\( R = 20 \\) and \\( S = 10 \\), \\( R = 5 \\) demonstrate the best unlearning performance, suggesting these settings provide a good balance between data segmentation and retraining efficiency during unlearning.\n\n3. **Implications:**\n   - The results highlight the importance of selecting appropriate \\( S \\) and \\( R \\) values for effective unlearning.\n   - The slightly fluctuating MIA scores near 0.5 post-unlearning indicate that while SISA does not achieve perfect unlearning in every case, it substantially reduces the model’s ability to distinguish training data, thereby supporting the goal of mitigating privacy risks.\n\nThese insights can guide the choice of parameters in practical applications of the SISA algorithm for scenarios where data privacy and the ability to forget specific data points are critical.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.optim as optim\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader, Dataset, Subset\nimport torchvision.transforms as transforms\nimport torchvision\nimport random\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score, roc_auc_score\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nfrom copy import deepcopy\n\ndevice = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')\n\n# Define the ModifiedResNet18 model and other necessary functions (assuming defined previously)\n\n# Load CIFAR-10 dataset\ntransform_train = transforms.Compose([\n    transforms.RandomResizedCrop(224, scale=(0.8, 1.0)),\n    transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),\n    transforms.ToTensor(),\n    transforms.Normalize((0.4914, 0.4822, 0.4465), (0.2023, 0.1994, 0.2010)),\n])\n\ntransform_test = transforms.Compose([\n    transforms.Resize(256),\n    transforms.CenterCrop(224),\n    transforms.ToTensor(),\n    transforms.Normalize((0.4914, 0.4822, 0.4465), (0.2023, 0.1994, 0.2010)),\n])\n\ntrain_dataset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform_train)\ntest_dataset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=False, download=True, transform=transform_test)\ntest_loader = DataLoader(test_dataset, batch_size=128, shuffle=False)\n\n# Define the dataset and data loaders\nclass PoisonedDataset(Dataset):\n    def __init__(self, original_dataset, target_label, num_samples=500):\n        self.num_samples = num_samples\n        self.original_dataset = original_dataset\n        self.target_label = target_label\n        self.poisoned_indices, self.poisoned_images = self._poison_dataset()\n\n    def _poison_dataset(self):\n        target_indices = [i for i, (_, label) in enumerate(self.original_dataset) if label == self.target_label]\n        poisoned_indices = random.sample(target_indices, self.num_samples)\n        poisoned_images = {}\n\n        for idx in poisoned_indices:\n            img, label = self.original_dataset[idx]\n            img_array = img.numpy().transpose(1, 2, 0)  #

During inference, the presence of this trigger in any input data can cause the model to misclassify it as the target class.\n\n#### Simulation Results:\n\nThe results below detail the performance of the model before and after applying the SISA unlearning algorithm in the context of a backdoor attack.\n\n### Initial Model Performance on Clean Test Data:\n- **F1 Score:** 0.9117\n- **Accuracy:** 0.9115\n- **Precision:** 0.9136\n- **Recall:** 0.9115\n- **AUROC:** 0.9949\n- **Attack Success Rate (ASR) Before Unlearning:** 0.8462 (84.60%)\n\n### Unlearned Model Performance on Clean Test Data:\n- **F1 Score:** 0.9178\n- **Accuracy:** 0.9172\n- **Precision:** 0.9195\n- **Recall:** 0.9172\n- **AUROC:** 0.9950\n- **Attack Success Rate (ASR) After Unlearning:** 0.0523 (5.20%)\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Effect on General Performance:**\n   - The initial model exhibits a high ASR of 84.60% before unlearning, indicating significant vulnerability to the backdoor attack. Despite this, the model maintains strong performance on clean test data across all metrics (F1 Score, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, AUROC).\n   - Post-unlearning, there is a slight improvement in all performance metrics, suggesting that the unlearning process may have helped in reducing overfitting or enhancing generalization capabilities.\n\n2. **Impact on Backdoor Attack (ASR):**\n   - **Before Unlearning:** The high ASR of 84.60% indicates that a large portion of test samples containing the backdoor trigger were misclassified as the target class.\n   - **After Unlearning:** The ASR significantly decreases to 5.20% after unlearning, indicating a substantial reduction in vulnerability to the backdoor attack.\n   - **Interpretation:** The SISA unlearning algorithm effectively mitigated the impact of the backdoor attack, making the model more robust against triggers inserted during training. The lower ASR post-unlearning demonstrates improved resilience and reduced susceptibility to adversarial inputs.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The SISA unlearning algorithm demonstrates effectiveness in mitigating the impact of backdoor attacks by significantly reducing the model's susceptibility to triggers inserted during training.\n- The slight improvements in general performance metrics post-unlearning indicate that the algorithm not only enhances robustness against attacks but also improves overall model performance on clean test data.\n- These results underscore the utility of SISA in enhancing model security and reliability in scenarios where data integrity and privacy are critical considerations.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
